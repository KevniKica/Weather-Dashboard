# Weather-Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard application using city names to find the weather conditions for 5 days.

I used AJAX(my brother helped me out with this) to obtain data from the API in JSON format. For current conditions it can display the city, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. And for the 5 day forecast, it can do the date, temperature, and humidity.

Includes a search history so you can view your past searches that you can even click onto to get a new forecast.

This is what it looks like when a city is searched, and you can see the city is saved in the search history![search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97704426/176367861-52c76ba8-0ab2-409e-8787-a66536cce49d.JPG)
